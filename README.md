## âš¡ Fun fact
Barroccio derives from latin term _birotium_ meaning a two-wheeled vehicle used to carry goods, stuff and any raw material in general where animal traction supports human activities.

The concept of name usage intends to pay homage of universal contribution support to human activities, in the particular context the systems automation activities support.
